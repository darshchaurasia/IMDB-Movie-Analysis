# IMDB-Movie-Analysis

## Description

This project aims to analyze an IMDb dataset containing information on various movies, including their budgets, gross revenue, IMDb scores, duration, and release years. Through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical modeling, I seek to understand trends in movie production and success. Key questions I aim to answer include:<br>


- How have movie budgets, gross revenues, and IMDb scores evolved over time?<br>
- What factors contribute most significantly to a movie's success, both in terms of box office gross and audience ratings?<br>
- Can we predict the gross revenue of a movie based on its budget?<br>


In this project, I use data visualization and regression analysis to uncover patterns and relationships within the data. The tools used include `Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `Statsmodels` for statistical analysis.
